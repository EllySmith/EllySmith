A motivated beginning frontend developer with a passion for professional growth. I hold a scientific background from La Sapienza University of Rome and have significant experience in interpersonal communication within the luxury goods sector, enabling me to collaborate effectively and integrate seamlessly into diverse teams. My journey into frontend development began while managing an e-commerce platform, which sparked my interest in this field. I have successfully completed training at Hexlet.io and am particularly enthusiastic about developing web applications, especially in the medical and scientific domains. I am fluent in Italian, Russian and English and am always ready to learn and grow in my career.
